                        This project involved a complete rebuild of the company’s main digital presence. I managed a team of developers, content strategists, and stakeholders to ensure a seamless transition. The project required extensive planning to maintain URL structures, reduce downtime, and integrate all site sections into a content Management system.
                    </p>
                    <p>Over 1,000 pages have been migrated into the Sitecore CMS, which has led to a large reduction in IT maintenance tickets (70%), and a large decrease in time to market for marketing initiatives (50% reduction).</p>

                        This initiative required implementing new tracking methodologies while ensuring seamless data continuity. I worked closely with engineers to set up custom tracking parameters and collaborated with legal teams to ensure all data collection met privacy requirements.
                    </p>
                    <p> In addition, I helped oversee project management of this cycle using Agile methodologies. Data architecture for the insurance division was necessary, as well as breaking down our silos of data tracking across about a dozen different teams. Tracking has become more efficient, 
                    and a new standards and process has been implemented. </p>
